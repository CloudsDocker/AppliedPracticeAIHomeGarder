The image you've sent is a close-up of four tomatoes on a tomato plant. The tomatoes are ripe, with red and green colors visible. The plant has green leaves, indicating it's healthy. However, there's no indication of any disease or pest infestation in the image. 

As for identification, this appears to be a common variety of tomato plant. For general care tips, it's important to ensure that the plant receives adequate sunlight (at least 6 hours per day) and watering to prevent wilted leaves. You should also prune your tomato plant regularly to promote healthy growth and remove any infected or damaged leaves. 

Please note that without more specific information about the location of the image, I cannot provide further details about any potential diseases or pests affecting the plant in the region. If you have concerns about the health of your tomato plants, it's always a good idea to consult with local gardening experts or extension services for guidance.
